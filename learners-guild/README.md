# Learners Guild Rocket.Chat

This is Learners Guild's custom fork of Rocket.Chat. The primary difference is the precense of a few custom plugins, a small startup script, and this readme.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

2. Checkout the `lg-master` branch.

3. Setup and run [mehserve][mehserve]. Then figure out which port you intend to use and create the mehserve config file:

        $ echo 3000 > ~/.mehserve/chat.learnersguild

4. Set your `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

        $ export NODE_ENV=development

5. Create your `.env` file for your environment. Example:

        APP_BASEURL=http://chat.learnersguild.dev
        ROOT_URL=http://chat.learnersguild.dev/
        JWT_PUBLIC_KEY="<IDM PUBLIC KEY (let it
        span
        multiple
        lines)>
        "

6. Install [Meteor][meteor]

        $ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

7. Run the server:

        $ learners-guild/start.sh

## Need to send a PR Upstream?

1. First, make sure we are tracking `upstream` via git:

        $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.git
        $ git remote update

2. Then, make sure our `develop` branch is sync'ed with `upstream`. If it's your first time:

        $ git checkout -b develop origin/develop

     If you've already worked from the `develop` branch before:

        $ git checkout develop

3. Merge any changes from `upstream`:

        $ git merge upstream/develop

4. Create a branch for your fix. Replace `YOUR_BRANCH_NAME` with something sensible, like your initials followed by the fix you're making, e.g., `jw/fix-double-notifications`:

        $ git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME

5. Make your changes. Test them. Commit to your branch, then push to origin:

        $ git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME

6. Then go [submit the pull request on Rocket.Chat upstream][rocket-chat-pr].

7. No need to wait for Rocket.Chat to merge-in your changes. In the meantime you can merge your branch with the branch from which we deploy, `lg-master`:

        $ git checkout lg-master
        $ git merge YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
        $ git push
        $ git push heroku lg-master:master


## Differences from Upstream

In order to maintain our own sanity, rather than making lots and lots of changes to Rocket.Chat, we've chosen a strategy of isolating our changes into a few meteor packages. At the time of this writing, those are:

## [learnersguild:rocketchat-lg-sso][rocketchat-lg-sso]

This package is how we integrate our SSO functionality (via [idm][idm]) into Rocket.Chat / Meteor.

## [learnersguild:rocketchat-lg-slash-commands][rocketchat-lg-slash-commands]

This package contains all of our custom `/slash` commands that interface with our Learners Guild services. For example, `/profile` and `/vote`.

The easiest way to test changes locally (that I've found so far) is to:

1. First, uninstall the package, e.g.:

        $ meteor remove learnersguild:rocketchat-lg-slash-commands

2. Then, create a symbolic link from your clone of the git repository of the package into the `packages` directory:

        $ ln -s ../../rocketchat-lg-slash-commands packages

3. Then, re-add the package (it will check the `/packages` folder first):

        $ meteor add learnersguild:rocketchat-lg-slash-commands

4. At this point, any changes you make in your cloned repository will cause the Meteor server to restart and the client to reload (which, on Meteor 1.2, takes forever). Once you're confident that things are working, you should bump the version number (using good [semver][semver] practices), publish the package to meteor, and reverse the process you did above:

        $ meteor remove learnersguild:rocketchat-lg-slash-commands
        $ rm packages/rocketchat-lg-slash-commands
        $ cd ../rocketchat-lg-slash-commands
        #
        # BUMP VERSION IN package.js
        #
        $ meteor publish
        $ cd ../Rocket.Chat
        $ meteor add learnersguild:rocketchat-lg-slash-commands

    When you re-add the package, be sure that it gets your _newer_ version. I've noticed that sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. In the worst case, you can edit the `.meteor/versions` file yourself.
