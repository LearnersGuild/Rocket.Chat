# learnersguild:rocketchat-lg-sso

Log in to Rocket.Chat using Learners Guild SSO.

This simple package listens for the creation of the `loginLayout` template in Rocket.Chat, and initiates a cookie-based login process based on Learners Guild's SSO / Identity Management (IDM) service.

**NOTE:** This package will likely not be useful for anyone outside of [Learners Guild][learnersguild].
